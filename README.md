ABSTRACT
The outcomes of urban analyses and other decision-making processes can affect urban policy. As these focus on large-scale geographies, there is a void in the understanding of the people who inhabit the places being analyzed. This project aims to introduce empathy into the urban planning process by generating synthetic narratives of people based on data about places. Its central question is as follows: can you better understand a place by engaging with narratives of its archetypal inhabitants? 
This project proposes an interdisciplinary approach to crafting narratives from existing place-based data. By combining elements of creative storytelling with traditional empirical data, the project provides an avenue for poetism in the urban research process. To this end, the project proposes a web-based visualization tool for exploring the city at the human scale that stems from the idea that empathy can arise from “walking a mile in a person’s shoes.”
